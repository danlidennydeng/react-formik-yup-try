# react-formik-yup-try

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-formik-yup-try)

Is yup really necessary? Is the length of code only advantage here?

{...formik.getFieldProps('firstName')}

# at very begining, the error message won't show "15 or less" error message unless you tab to next. Should this not be a default behavior
